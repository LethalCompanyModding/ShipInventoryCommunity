# ShipInventory
## Overview
ShipInventory is a mod that adds an inventory to the ship, allowing to store items safely.

> [!NOTE]
> This mod is a fork of the [original mod](https://github.com/WarperSan/ShipInventory).

## Features
### Chute
By holding an item to the chute, you will store the item into the ship's inventory.

### Terminal Interface
By typing `ship` into the terminal, a menu will allow you to retrieve any item stored in the inventory.

*Big thanks to [minimusubi](https://github.com/minimusubi) for reworking the terminal UI!*

### Highly Customizable
This mod offers a bunch of settings to customize the chute as much as you want!

### Saving Compatible
The inventory will be added in your save file. You can freely keep items in it without worrying losing them!

> [!WARNING]
> Adding or removing mods with their modded items inside the inventory may lose these items.

### Localization Support
This mod natively supports localization. You simply need to copy `en.json`, translate the fields and assign the `Language` config to your language code (e.g.: `fr` will read the `fr.json` file).
